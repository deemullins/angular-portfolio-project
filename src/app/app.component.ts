  aboutMe = 'Let’s see, what can I say about myself? I’m getting to that place where I want to do what makes me happy. At the beginning of 2018 I was selected for a  Google Scholarship that gave me access to a 12 week Front-End Web Development program partnered with Udacity.  I did well and was selected for Phase II as I was in the top 10% out of the 15,000 others which gave me a 6 month Nanodegree with Udacity and Google that I am currently participating in.  For help I am active in many web dev groups on Facebook and Twitter as well as Slack channels.  Other than that I love my espresso in the morning, traveling and attending music festivals throughout the year.   To me, it’s all about seeing the world and making memories with those places and people who matter while doing what keeps the smile on my face.  I also want to get stuff done, work hard and continue learning.';
